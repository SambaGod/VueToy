This is a toy project I created while learning from youtube -> Travery Media. Had worked with Vue long time ago but would like to know more about what's new in Vue 3.

The random user generator was developed simply by using the Vue CDN.
For the task tracker app, Vue CLI was used.

`npm i -g @vue/cli`

- Projects can be created and managed easily using the built in Vue UI
  `vue ui`
- To create project from command line instead, run:
  `vue create {project_name}`
