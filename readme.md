This is a toy project I created while learning from youtube -> Travery Media. Had worked with Vue long time ago but would like to know more about what's new in Vue 3.

The random user generator was developed simply by using the Vue CDN.
For the task tracker app, Vue CLI was used.

## Project Background

`npm i -g @vue/cli`

- Projects can be created and managed easily using the built in Vue UI
  `vue ui`

- To create project from command line instead, run:
  `vue create {project_name}`

- To test API, we installed json-server
  `npm i json-server`

- In case router wasn't installed previously, we can install it via:
  `npm i vue-router@next`

## Run This Project

Install dependencies: `npm install`
Run frontend: `npm run serve`
Run backend: `npm run backend`
